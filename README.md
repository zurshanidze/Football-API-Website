# FootballAPI Live Scores Dashboard

The 'Football' project is a dynamic website built with JavaScript that leverages a real Football API. Users can view real-time match results and future fixtures for top and second-tier football leagues, with the ability to filter by day, month, and year.

This project is a great example of how web technologies can be used to create an engaging and informative platform for football enthusiasts. New Football Website with React, (which I'll tell you more about later), for better user experience and preformance.
